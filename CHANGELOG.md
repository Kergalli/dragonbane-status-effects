- **Import/Export Stability**: All file operations use V13-compatible utilities

### ðŸ“‹ Breaking Changes

**Status Effect ID Format**

- **Effect IDs Updated**: All built-in effect IDs changed from dots to hyphens for V13 compatibility
  - V12: `dse.burning`, `dse.blind`, `dse.cold` â†’ V13: `dse-burning`, `dse-blind`, `dse-cold`
  - **Impact**: Active effects on tokens will need to be reapplied
  - **Impact**: Custom descriptions will need to be re-entered or manually migrated
  - **Impact**: Built-in effect customizations will need to be reconfigured
- **Minimum Foundry**: Now requires Foundry V13 (use v1.x for V12 compatibility)
- **Module Version**: Bumped to 2.0.0 to reflect major Foundry version support change

### ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

**From V12 to V13**

- **Seamless from v1.0.2**: Users upgrading from v1.0.2 (V12 with hyphens) will experience seamless migration with no breaking changes
- **Breaking from v1.0.1**: Users upgrading directly from v1.0.1 (V12 with dots) will experience breaking changes due to ID format differences
- **Effect ID Changes**: The dot-to-hyphen change was required for V13's HandlebarsApplicationMixin compatibility
- **Why This Change**: V13's template rendering system cannot handle object paths with dots in property names
