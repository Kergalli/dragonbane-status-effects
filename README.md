## 🔧 Foundry V13 Compatibility

### ✅ What's New in V13

- **Full V13 Support**: Complete compatibility with Foundry VTT V13's new architecture
- **Modern APIs**: Updated to use V13's namespaced functions and improved error handling
- **Enhanced Stability**: Defensive filtering prevents V13-specific rendering issues
- **ID Format Update**: Effect IDs changed from dots to hyphens for V13 template compatibility

### 🔄 Upgrading from V12

- **⚠️ Migration Path Matters**:
  - **From v1.0.2**: Seamless upgrade with no breaking changes
  - **From v1.0.1**: Breaking changes due to status effect ID format differences
- **ID Format Changes**: Effect IDs use hyphens in v1.0.2+ for V13 template compatibility
- **Version Requirement**: V13 users should use v2.x releases; V12 users should stay on v1.x releases

## ✅ Compatibility

### 🎯 Total Compatibility

- **Dragonbane System**: Complete integration with conditions and mechanics
- **YZE Combat**: Preserves action tracking functionality perfectly
- **Visual Active Effects**: Status effect descriptions work seamlessly
- **Dfreds Effects Panel**: Status effect descriptions work seamlessly

### ⚠️ Known Issues

**Condition Lab & Triggler**: Essentially trying to do the same thing, will conflict on several levels

**Monk's Little Details**: The Enhanced Token HUD Layout may conflict with some Monk's Little Details settings.

If status effect icons appear incorrectly, disable these options in Monk's Little Details:

- "Alter the Token HUD status effects"
- "Clear All"
- "Highlight Token HUD status effects"

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Custom effects not appearing**: Make sure to click "Save All Effects" in the Custom Effects Editor and reload the world.

**Token HUD not styled**: Check that "Enhanced Token HUD Layout" is enabled in module settings.

**Token effects disappeared after V13 upgrade**: This is expected due to the ID format change. Simply reapply the effects - they'll work correctly with the new format.
